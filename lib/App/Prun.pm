=head1 NAME

App::Prun - Provides the prun script as a command line interface to L<Parallel::ForkManager>.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSYS

    for nr in `seq 1..100`; do echo "echo command #$nr" | prun

    prun command_file_to_run_in_parallel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<prun> allows you to utilize multiple CPUs
for some workloads from the shell more easily.

prun takes a list of commands (stdin and/or from file(s)) and run the commands
in parallel.

prun is a CLI front end to L<Parallel::ForkManager>. It runs commands in
parallel up to a maximum number of processes at once.

=over

=item * prun --help

=item * L<Parallel::ForkManager>

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

There are also examples available from the command line B<--help>.

Run tkprof against all .trc files in the current directory, run 32
of them at a time.

  for F in *.trc; do echo "tkprof $F ${F%trc}txt"; done | prun -p 32

Run all commands in a file (command_file), one line at a time.  Run
the default number of processes in parallel ($def_processes).
Ignore any failed processes, but do report to STDOUT any that fail.

  prun -e -r command_file
